# Where to find the vhost file
# This is relative to the playbook directory.
# The template module is used to copy this file to the server
# example: roles/webapp/templates/site.conf
nginx_vhost_src:

# Take the basename as default name
# roles/webapp/files/webapp.conf -> webapp.conf
nginx_vhost_name: "{{ nginx_vhost_src | basename }}"
